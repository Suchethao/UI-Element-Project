        <h1>Today's Prediction</h1>
        <h2>Two different sides may tug on you today, and neither one may really make a strong case for pulling you one way or the other, Aries. Realize that adjustments may have to be made for you to fit in with the scheme of things and fulfill your duties and responsibilities. A close loved one may distract you in subtle ways, so try not to get sidetracked if you can help it.</h2>

        <h2>Tension may be a bit high with everyone and everything you encounter today, Taurus. There will be a strong need for stability and discipline, while others call for fun and frivolity. You may be caught in the middle. The worst thing is that no side, including yours, is going to want to compromise. Try not to take things too seriously.        </h2>

        <h2>Remember that you're here to have fun, and happiness is your true destiny, Gemini. Keep this in mind today, as forces may tend to pull you away from the fun you've been having. There may be a rather sobering tone to the day that's stubbornly trying to rain on your parade. Recognize the need for structure and stability, but don't let it bring you down.</h2>

        <h2>You will recognize and appreciate the need for structure and stability on a day like today, Cancer. This practical energy may work to take away some of the fun out of the equation. You may not realize it, but the fun in your life may be getting chipped away little by little. Hold tight to the things that give you passion and purpose in life. These are the keys to healthy living.        </h2>

You may encourage a focus on the collective while others seem too worried about themselves. Yet another force is calling for outdated remedies and traditional structures that no longer suit your purposes. Blaze your own trail.</h2>

You may find that a combination of powerful forces is trying to win you over to their camp. Don't pigeonhole yourself into one way of doing things. Keep in mind that the best route is often a combination of several different paths.</h2>

The imbalance between having fun and taking care of practical matters is currently working to slowly destroy the good thing that you have going. Nip this problem in the bud.</h2>

The happy, jovial approach tells you to let loose, be courageous, and strike out with conviction toward the things that mean the most to you. A sense of duty and restriction may be holding you back. Take the best of both worlds and come up with a unique plan of attack.</h2>

Without this foundation, you will be hard pressed to establish any walls or windows.</h2>
